## Akai APC40 control script for Bitwig Studio

This is a custom Akai APC40 control script for Bitwig Studio.

Currently, this is the only available Akai APC40 control script
for Bitwig Studio. :)

***

### Status

As of February 26, 2014, it's on early development stage, though some of the
major features are more or less done and tested:

* Clip launcher
* User mapping of all knobs (with LED feedback) and crossfader
* Fader automapping to track volume
* Transport (play/stop/rec)

What's not ready yet / working on:

* Track mute/solo/arm buttons
* Track selectors, device/track control banks
* Mapping of all other buttons (ie. nudge, tap tempo, metronome etc)

Script was only tested with Linux version of Bitwig Studio, so testers from
other platforms are welcome.

***

### Known bugs

See [issues](https://github.com/stylemistake/bitwig_apc40/issues).

***

### Installation

Place all repository tree into `Bitwig Studio/Controller Scripts` folder,
restart Bitwig Studio and check settings.

***

### Misc

* Rotating `cue level` knob while holding `shift` will change the tempo.
* Crossfader has two virtual controls (each for A and B decks). While
mapping crossfader, move right to map A, move left to map B.
