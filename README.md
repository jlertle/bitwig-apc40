## APC40 mapping script for Bitwig Studio

This is a custom mapping script for Akai APC40 performance
controller to control Bitwig Studio.

***

### Status

As of February 25, 2014, it is in early development state with a very small
feature set, though some of them are more or less done:

* Modeswitching (currently using mode 2)
* User mapping of device knobs and track knobs
* User mapping of crossfader (with two virtual controls for A and B tracks)
* Knob LED feedback from Bitwig Studio

There are some bugs with LED feedback, but they won't be fixed until
everything else is done.

Script was only tested with Linux version of Bitwig Studio, so testers from
other platforms are welcome.

Also, as of the same date, this is the only publicly available mapping for
Akai APC40. :)

### Installation

Place all repository tree into `Bitwig Studio/Controller Scripts` folder,
restart Bitwig Studio and check settings.
